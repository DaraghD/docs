# mautrix-discord
Welcome to the mautrix-discord docs!

Use the sidebar to find the relevant pages. Things that are the same for all
bridges, like setting up the bridge, are right below the "Go-based bridges"
header. Things specific to mautrix-discord are under this page.

These docs are mostly targeted towards people who are hosting the bridge
themselves. If you don't want to host it yourself, you can use a public
instance. When using public instances, refer to their instructions and support
rooms.

* [beeper.com](https://www.beeper.com/) (paid service with lots of bridges)

If you run a public instance and wish to list it here, please [make a pull request](https://github.com/mautrix/docs/blob/master/bridges/go/discord/index.md).
